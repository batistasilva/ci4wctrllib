What was made on lib projet?
----------------------------
Was set up a configuration to application start, without (http://localhost/myapp/public/index.php) to 
(http://localhost/myapp/). What was made, was create 2 file [.htaccess]. One in root from application, and
other in folder public. As well was changed ( public $indexPage = 'index.php';) , from folder (/app/Config/App.php), to
   ( public $indexPage = '';). 

Was set up  a configuration to read conection to mysql from .env file.

Was made a lib class to connect to mysql by PDO drive, return a entity class.

Was made a test on a page user-view, and everything work well.

Structure of project to work fine:

App - Libraries - Mypdo
App - Entities - User
App - Models - UserModel
App - Config - Routes, was create that Router = $routes->get('users', 'UserCrud::users');
App - Controllers - UserCrud
App - Views - user_view

What need's to do?

Create that others module to add-user, create-user, update-user and delete.


That's it...


I'm happy to have done that..
